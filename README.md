# Senior Capping Project
This repository contains some of the contributions that I made to my team's senior computer science project at Marist College.

### Project Scope
To design a corporate directory for a hypothetical company called ACME. The directory needed to be available 24/7 to over 100,000 employees and provide all the services that each department of the company may need, from standard employees to Human Resource employees. Myself and four other developers were responsible for the full design, development, testing and deployment of the application.

We built the company's application using Angular 2, Node.js and PostgreSQL. The repository containing the full project can be found [here](https://github.com/kaylamesmain/capping475).
